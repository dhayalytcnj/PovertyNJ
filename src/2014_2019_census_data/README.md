This Project's focus is on identifying whether or not poverty is racially motivated to some degree, implementing NJ Census data going back up to the past few years, and display that data through an interactive NJ county map.

The end result is to have 2 components:
1. Display the correlation of poverty and ethnicity via an interactive NJ county map to select county of choice, and visually communicate the data of that county on ethnicities in poverty. 

2. Present ways for the user to assist in this issue, such as contact county officials and donation options for existing organizations that deal with anti-poverty.
