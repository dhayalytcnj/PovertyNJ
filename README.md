This Project's focus is on identifying whether or not poverty is racially motivated to some degree, implementing NJ Census data from over the past 10 years. 

The end result is to be able to display the correlation of poverty and ethnicity in multiple visual ways (graphs, charts), provide links to articles used as references, and etc.
